# Welcome to the Bender Factory

This repository contains tools and data to generate a community-maintained webpage for the
recordings and stems of [Colin Bender](https://colinbenders.com/)'s Modular Lockdown series.

## What is Modular Lockdown?

Several times a week Colin [streams](https://www.twitch.tv/colinbenders) a ~3
hour live jam session on his modular synth.  Some tracks are saved as
multi-track recordings.  These recordings get shared for the community to
download and remix.

## How do I get involved?

First step is to join the "Bender Factory" section on the [discord](https://discord.gg/modularmayhem).  You'll have to go into the `#tos` channel first
to gain access to the other channels.  Ping `@achin` in the `#dev` channel.

### What can I help with?

We need help with the following things:

* HTML design and development.
* Make sure all the metadata for each recording and track is accurate.  For more on this, see the [data](https://github.com/eminence/benderfactory/tree/main/data) folder.
* If you have bandwidth and/or diskspace, consider helping to host the data. Ask
  in discord about how to do this.

## Where do I find the actual URL to this webpage?

Check out the `#stems` channel on [discord](https://discord.gg/modularmayhem).

## Why IPFS?

It's neat tech, and seems like it can help us making a lot of data available
to people to browse.
