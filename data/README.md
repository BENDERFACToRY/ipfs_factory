# Data

This folder contains all of the metadata for each modular lockdown
season, for each recording in a season, and for each track in a
recording.

If you are going to edit these JSON files, it is recommended that you use an editor
with support for JSDON schema validation (for example, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Recording data

### Youtube links
Each recording should have a link to the youtube replay of the
live stream.  Idealy the youtube link should be timestampped so
that clicking on it goes directly to the jam.  Some recordings
don't have a timestamp, so help with finding the right timestamps
is needed.

### Tags

Each recording can have tags associated with it.  When browsing the recording
list, you can filter on these tags.  At the moment, all of the tags are
"placeholder" made-up values.  Help is needed to come up with a real set
of tags for each recording.

### BPM

Each recording can list it's tempo, measured in beats-per-minute.  Help is needed
measuring the BPM for each recording.

## Track data

### Track name
The track "name" is just a short title for what the track is, like "kick drum" or
"arp".  Help is needed identifying names for each track

### Patch notes
Each track can have a "patch notes" section where extra info can be stored.  This
info could be actual notes about the patch that made this voice, or any other
information that could be useful to someone listening to the track.
